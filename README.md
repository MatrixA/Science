## Welcome to My Science Board
This board is recording my research progress of underwater SLAM, including papers I read, projects I run and plans I made.

### Papers
I think there are three types of papers. Following papers are all about SLAM.
1. Review


2. Method
* 施小成, 和王晓娟. 《一种面向AUV水下对接的双目视觉测距方法》. 计算机测量与控制, 期 10 (2008年): 1460-1462+1488.


3. Application

### Projects
I will run some SLAM demo on Github. In order to realize docking, I will create my own system.
1. SLAM

2. Object Detection


2020-11-29 A BERT model for classify style of 5 writers'(LuXun,WangXiaobo,QianZhongshu,Moyan,ZhangAiling) article. 97% accuracy.

### Plans
Before 2021, I think 50 abstracts are needed at least.
In addition, I should design a method to dock efficiently.

### Ref
Datasets:KITTI etc.

### Tools
* Roam Research
* Zotero
* 印象笔记
