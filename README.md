## Welcome to My Science Board
This board is recording my research progress of underwater SLAM, including papers I read, projects I run and plans I made.

[TOC]

### Papers
I think there are three types of papers. Following papers are all about SLAM.
1. Review

2. Method

3. Application

### Projects
I will run some SLAM demo on Github. In order to realize docking, I will create my own system.
1. SLAM

2. Object Detection

### Plans
Before 2021, I think 50 abstracts are needed at least.
In addition, I should design a method to dock efficiently.
